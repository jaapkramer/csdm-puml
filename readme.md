# CSDM PlantUML
The original work is a PlantUML implementation of the CSDM model. The original work is a great start, but i missed several classes. This repo is an attempt to build upon the original work and add the missing classes.

The work in this repo is based upon https://github.com/sanjayraina/csdm-puml and is described in the blog post [Using Diagram as Code for CSDM Implementation](https://medium.com/@sanjayraina/using-diagram-as-code-for-csdm-implementation-4c2d93181b44).



### New Classes
- SDLC
- CI Resource Group
- Application
- Information Object
